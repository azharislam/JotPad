# JottyPad

JottyPad is an iOS application built using SwiftUI. It also uses the PencilKit library. I built this app to practice SwiftUI principles. I liked the final product so much that I submitted it to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jottypad/id1557555747)

## Installation

Just clone the project and run on simulator/device. 

Will need Xcode 12 and above. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azharislam/JotPad.git
```
